# Obsidian YouVersion Plugin

**Obsidian plugin that automatically link bible verses to YouVersion bible.**

You need to just type for example: `John 1:1-6`.

I'm from Poland so plugin supports polish books names (eq. `J 1:1-6`, `Mt 24,1`). If you would like it to support your language books names feel free to make PR (you need to create json in `data/books` and add it in `src/Books.ts`).

The plugins is heavily inspired by [obsidian-bible-reference](https://github.com/tim-hub/obsidian-bible-reference) (also i have "borrowed" some code from there) so check it out.
